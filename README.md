# Data-Science-Capstone-Final-Project
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

This GitHub Repository includes: 
- A presentation created with R Studio Presenter (R Pubs) pitching to potential investors both the app and the algorithm
- A text prediction Shiny app URL (running on shinyapps.io); where a user inputs multiple words in a text box on the left and the application displays (returns) a prediction of the next word on the right side of the screen
- Data files from blogs, twitter and news

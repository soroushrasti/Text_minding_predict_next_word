# Text minding
The goal of this project is to create a product to highlight a prediction algorithm that I have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. This repository includes:

A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching my algorithm and app.

This GitHub Repository includes: 
- A presentation created with R Studio Presenter (R Pubs) pitching to potential investors both the app and the algorithm
- A text prediction Shiny app URL (running on shinyapps.io); where a user inputs multiple words in a text box on the left and the application displays (returns) a prediction of the next word on the right side of the screen
- The result of the algorithm trained on blogs, twitter and news resources in "RData" format
